# Design Pattern Term Project

This is a ......
To be written at a later date XD

The project is inspired by [Schuchertâ€™s Monopoly Kata](https://schuchert.wikispaces.com/Monopoly%28r%29).

## Problem Statement

Monopoly is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions.

Implement the game with a Test-Driven Approach. With the roll of the dice, users should be able to see the graphic interface implement his/her turn by updating the money, position, and status of the player. A simpler version of the rules may be used to decrease the size of the project.
